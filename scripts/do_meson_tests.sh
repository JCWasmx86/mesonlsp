# Failing tests:
# common/158 disabler: I don't understand what the behavior of disablers is
# common/162 subdir if_found: Expected failure
# common/187 args flattening: Argument flattening not implemented
# common/223 persubproject options: Subprojects are not implemented
# common/49 custom target: Something weird with disablers
# common/67 modules: Unimplemented test module. Won't be implemented.
# failing/11 object arithmetic: Expected failure
# failing/12 string arithmetic: Expected failure
# failing/13 array arithmetic: Expected failure
# failing/15 kwarg before arg: Expected failure
# failing/18 wrong plusassign: Expected failure
# failing/39 kwarg assign: Expected failure
# failing/3 missing subdir: Expected failure
# failing/49 executable comparison: Expected failure
# failing/4 missing meson.build: Expected failure
# failing/50 inconsistent comparison: Expected failure
# failing/57 assign custom target index: Expected failure
# failing/5 misplaced option: Expected failure
# failing/97 subdir parse error: Expected failure
# frameworks/23 hotdoc: Missing kwargs for the hotdoc module, but I did not find their types
# frameworks/4 qt: Bad search for the missing method, if it couldn't be inferred due to having no string literal as argument
# unit/21 exit status: Expected failure
# unit/25 non-permitted kwargs: Expected failure
