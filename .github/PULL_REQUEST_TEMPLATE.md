Checklist:
- [ ] Did you update the CHANGELOG?
- [ ] If you introduced dependencies: Did you update the `mesonlsp.spec`, `scripts/create_license_file.sh` and *all* GitHub Actions files?
- [ ] Did you run a profiler, if you inserted a lot of C++ code, especially in the Lexer, Parser or the Type Analyzer?

Fixes #NNNN
